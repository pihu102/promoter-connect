      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Built by a promoter, for a promoter.</strong><br><br>
        Iâ€™ve worked as a promoter myself. I know how much effort goes in on the ground â€” and how often middlemen take a big cut, leaving promoters with much less than they deserve. Thatâ€™s why I started <strong>Promoter Connect</strong> â€” a platform where promoters and companies can connect directly, work fairly, and grow together. No middlemen. No hidden charges. Just real people and real opportunities.
